# Never-Trust-Public-Forums
Never go to Forums.

forums like
answers.microsoft.com
kubuntuforums.net duc.avid.com

the admins are working to protect BigTech...
the job is protect the image of BigTech,
and pretend they are helping.
redirect people to buy BigTech products,
counterincentive, disincentive, discourage, deterrent, demoralize, suppress people.

Not solve real problems.
Not give real help.

in microsoft are called "Volunteers"

forums are a scam.
